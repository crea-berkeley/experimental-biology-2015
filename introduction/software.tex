We've developed software to retrieve article abstracts from PubMed, filter out sentences
that do not contain verbs in our chosen vocabulary, parse sentences to examine their phrase
structure and lastly extract relations (i.e. subject-predicate-object triples) by pattern
matching on the phrase structure of parsed sentences.

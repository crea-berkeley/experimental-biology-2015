Then, we took the relations we extracted from article abstracts - our model - and exported them to a GEXF graph file \cite{thegexfworkinggroup2009}.
This allowed us to view \& analyze our model using the Gephi graph visualization software
\cite{conf/icwsm/BastianHJ09}, and also present it in our interactive graph
visualization viewable in your web browser. It appears as though graph clustering algorithms, such as Chinese Whispers \cite{Biemann:2006:CWE:1654758.1654774}
, group nouns (i.e. nodes on our graph) with similar meaning together, much like how we categorize nouns by colour on the model of neuroendocrine
aging that we originally built by hand. Though, we need to make further comparisons between our programmatically-constructed
models of neuroendocrine aging and our hand-constructed model of neuroendocrine endocrine, in order to determine precisely how well a
clustering algorithm like Chinese Whispers correctly clusters words with similar meaning together.

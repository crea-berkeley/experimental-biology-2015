Previous work in the relation extraction and semantic web communities, such as Carnegie Mellon's
\href{http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/rtw/}{Read the Web} \cite{Carlson10towardan} project and the University of Mannheim's
\href{http://dbpedia.org/}{DBpedia} \cite{dbpedia-swj} project, inspired us to find a method for constructing
our model of neuroendocrine aging programmatically. Neither project provided us with precisely
the software tools we needed to retrieve article abstracts and extract relations from them,
so we felt it necessary to develop our own.

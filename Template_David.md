### Introduction

* _The problem_: too much literature, too much information, stored in inaccessible formats, not semantically structured and organized
* _Computer science can help!_ Idea of storing knowledge digitally, and use graphs to build connections between them
* _Expected advantages_: manipulate data easily, see patterns clearly, knowledge base accessibility 

### Materials needed

* **1** friendly professor
* **1** computer science major
* **1** computer science / whateverelseeddieis major
* **1** computer science / math major
* **1** biology / math major
* **1** stats major
* **1** software engineer

### Method

* Use a NLP engine to process and extract relations of PubMed article abstracts 
  * Relations are a 3-tuple of (subject, predicate, object)
* Filter these relations
* Plot them on a graph
* Analyse the graph to find patterns, or possible optimizations of to the algorithm
* Repeat

### Discussion

**Only a tool, not made to replace reading!**

_NLP_: Effectiveness of using computer science data structures (particularly graph structures) to store knowledge

* Explore connections of known relations to find new ones mentioned in new papers 
* Find papers that back up a relation `link`
* Find papers that support or contradict each other `edge`
* Find the importance of something, i.e. its multitude of relations to others `histogram`

_Web App_: Supporting transparency of our research

* Visualizing the relations to easily identify connections `graph`
  * A tool to find large-scale trends and relations previously overlooked
* An simpler interface for anyone to use `interaction`
* A way to test and reflect the well-roundedness of this method 

### Conclusion

* We'll have to see ;)

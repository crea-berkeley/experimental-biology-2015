Prior to starting this project, we had been building a model of neuroendocrine aging by hand: we read article abstracts
ourselves, finding relations between two nouns in sentences and then adding them to our model. This
method of building a model of neuroendocrine aging appears ineffective to us, as articles about neuroendocrine
aging are published at an ever-increasing rate.

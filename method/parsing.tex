Here's a brief explanation of how to parse sentences for their phrase-structure: first assign each word in the sentence a part-of-speech tag,
then groups words into phrases and lastly group phrases into clauses. Sentences can contain multiple clauses, and each clause relates a
subject noun to an object noun with a predicate verb; the Penn Treebank Project \cite{mihaisurdeanu2015} provides a description for each tag used when parsing sentences
and annotating them for their phrase-structure.
